# reporter
Utility to create reports based on template statements and student data.  This is a really simple program that uses 2 csv files to create reports.  It was used successfully by the department I work in for all reports in the Summer term of 2016.

This version was written over an evening to minimise admin workload and the current source base is very specific to my needs.  The project will clearly benefit from being generalised - something that may happen when my requirements change.

## Input Data
* See example_data/ folder for sample input data.
